Title: Workstation access to "temp" file system failing
---

Last week we began having intermittent problems with workstations (Windows or Mac) accessing the “temp” file system.
Sometimes workstations will connect without issue, other times you will get a message similar to “logon failure”.
This problem seems to have been getting progressively worse.  Access from rhino/gizmo compute systems is unaffected
by this problem. We have been working with the vendor on a resolution, but as of this time, we don’t know the cause
of this problem. Updates will follow as we get new information. If you have any questions or need assistance, please
email scicomp@fredhutch.org
