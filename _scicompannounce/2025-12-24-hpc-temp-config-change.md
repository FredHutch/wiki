Title: Configuration change to hpc temp
---

In an attempt to fix the [recent SMB connection issues to hpc temp](/_scicompannounce/2025-10-29-workstations-hpc-temp)
from Mac & Windows, we will be making a configuration change to the Vast storage platform on Tuesday December 30 at 3:00 PM. This work
should be transparent to end users and no action is required on your part. If you do encounter issues, contact scicomp@fredhutch.org.
