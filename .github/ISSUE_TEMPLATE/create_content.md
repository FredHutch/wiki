## Learning Objective

- Talk about what essential skill is being shown. I like to write it up as a learning objective that is action-based, such as:
    - After reading this page, you will be able to: **utilize** the `screen` command to keep interactive jobs running on `rhino` and `gizmo` after logging out
    - Use the learning objective to define what you write about

## Why Should I Learn This?

- Talk about the context in which you use the command / skill
- Talk about what you can accomplish / make easier with this command or skill

## How to use this

- Focus on the “happy path”, the one that 95% of users will use when writing.
- Lay a map out first for complicated tasks, and then go through each step of the map
- You can add the options and edge cases at the end.

## Connect the Information

- Are there existing pages in SciWiki that are related and also helpful?
- Add the link and add context - why is the link helpful to the user?
- Resources and help
