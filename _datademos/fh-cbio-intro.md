Introduction to the [Fred Hutch instance of cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.fredhutch.org/) and a demonstration of its usage in the context of research data.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this article, you will learn:

- What **cBioPortal** is and how it can help with your research.
- What the [**Fred Hutch instance of cBioPortal**](https://cbioportal.fredhutch.org/) is and steps to take to upload your data onto the instance.
- Ways to format your data for upload into cBioPortal.

### What can you do with cBioportal?

There are innumerable ways you can leverage the vast amount of data on cBioPortal. In the example below, we demonstrate how you can harness some of the capabilities of cBioPortal to facilitate your own research. 

*Note: The examples below are demonstrated using the public instance of cBioPortal but can be replicated in the Fred Hutch instance as well)*

***As an example, let us say you identified KRAS as an important gene in cancer. Let's see how we can use cBioPortal to expand this observation leveraging publicly available datasets.***

***Question 1: How often is KRAS mutated in cancers?***

- Using cBioPortal, you can explore the frequency of *KRAS* mutations in different cancers, for example here we look at colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/oncoprint?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival">This analysis</a> shows that *KRAS* is mutated in 26% of patients across these studies. You can similarly investigate other studies (over 400 publicly available datasets) on cBioPortal.
![oncoprint_kras_different_studies](/datademos/assets/cbio_01_oncoprint_kras_different_studies.png)

- With cBioPortal, you can explore the different types of mutations in *KRAS*, such as single-nucleotide variations, insertions, deletions, and copy number changes. These can be visualized in OncoPrint format like above (showing mutations in genes for each sample), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/mutations?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival">lollipop format</a> like below (showing where mutations occur on the protein), and many others.
![KRAS_lollipop](/datademos/assets/cbio_02_KRAS_lollipop.png)

- Additionally, cBioPortal's direct integration with external databases such as ClinVar, COSMIC, etc. allows you to evaluate the impact of these genomic alterations. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/mutations?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival">Here</a> you can see each mutation in *KRAS* and its prediction of pathogenicity by [OncoKB](https://www.oncokb.org/) and [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) databases.
![KRAS_oncokb](/datademos/assets/cbio_03_KRAS_oncokb.png)

Thus with cBioPortal, exploring published multi-omics data becomes easier without needing to download raw data files, process them, and manually create visualizations. It also provides you with a one-stop shop to evaluate specific mutations by referencing external databases as well. The platform makes the entire process seamless and user-friendly.

***Question 2: Are mutations in KRAS associated with any clinical parameters such as sex, age, etc.?***
- With cBioPortal, you can visualize genomic data, such as mutations, alongside clinical factors like sex, age at diagnosis, or smoking history. This allows for a deeper understanding of how these **clinical traits may correlate with specific genetic changes**. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/oncoprint?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival">example below</a>, we can add tracks representing patient sex, age at diagnosis, and history of smoking in subjects with mutations in *KRAS*. You can see that *KRAS* mutations are frequent in individuals with a history of smoking.
![KRAS_clinical_covariates](/datademos/assets/cbio_04_KRAS_clinical_covariates.png)

- You can also correlate if specific clinical covariates are associated with certain mutation types or expression like in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/comparison?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=clinical">screenshot below</a>. Even if you have a particular tool in mind that you're more comfortable with, users can download the underlying data and analyze it outside of cBioPortal.
![KRAS_clinical_mut](/datademos/assets/cbio_05_KRAS_clinical_mut.png)

Overlaying clinical data with genomic data is crucial for discovering novel associations between genetic mutations and patient outcomes. This integration can help you identify patterns that may not be apparent from analyzing genetic data alone. By combining both types of data, it becomes easier to uncover critical insights that can lead to better predictions of survival and improved treatment strategies.

***Question 3: Do KRAS mutations co-occur with other kinds of mutations?***
- You can also utilize the cBioPortal platform to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/mutualExclusivity?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS%250AEGFR%250ACDKN2A&comparison_subtab=clinical&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&geneset_list=%20">identify if specific genes co-mutate</a> with *KRAS*. Alternatively, you could assess if they are mutually exclusive to *KRAS* mutations.
![KRAS_cooccurence](/datademos/assets/cbio_06_KRAS_cooccurence.png)

These analyses can reveal alternative therapeutic targets by identifying genes that often co-occur with mutations (co-occurrence) or show mutually exclusive patterns (synthetic lethal interactions). Ultimately, these findings can improve predictions for patient outcomes and guide research direction to identify personalized, effective therapies.

***Question 4: Do KRAS mutations affect survival or disease progression?***
- Using cBioportal, you can explore the relationship between *KRAS* mutations and overall survival in the three cohorts. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/comparison?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&geneset_list=%20">analysis below</a>, it appears the *KRAS* mutant tumors have a worse overall survival compared to those cancer patients with unaltered *KRAS*.
![KRAS_OS](/datademos/assets/cbio_07_KRAS_OS.png) 

- You can also explore if *KRAS* mutations affect disease free survival. In this case, we see KRAS mutant tumors have a lower percentage of disease-free survival which is an important metric when considering oncogenic targets for therapeutic intervention.
![KRAS_DFS](/datademos/assets/cbio_08_KRAS_DFS.png)

cBioPortal provides a powerful platform for assessing overall survival and disease-free progression by integrating genomic alterations with clinical outcomes. The platform allows you to visualize survival curves, stratify patients by genetic features, and correlate these with clinical variables like treatment response. This helps in identifying potential biomarkers that could predict prognosis or guide personalized treatment strategies, making cBioPortal an invaluable resource for cancer research and clinical decision-making.

**Other examples of what you can explore with cBioPortal:**

- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/results/cnSegments?cancer_study_list=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga&tab_index=tab_visualize&profileFilter=mutations%2Cgistic%2Ccna%2Cstructural_variants&case_set_id=all&Action=Submit&gene_list=KRAS&comparison_subtab=survival&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&geneset_list=%20">**Copy number alterations:**</a> Explore large-scale genomic changes, such as amplifications or deletions, using cBioPortalâ€™s "CN Segments" tab. *For example, you could compare copy number profiles of KRAS mutant tumors to non-mutant ones to identify patterns linked to KRAS mutations.*
- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=nsclc_tcga_broad_2016%2Cpaad_tcga%2Ccoadread_tcga">**Create custom cohorts:**</a> Build groups based on genetic mutations or clinical data relevant to your research. *For example, you could focus on lung adenocarcinoma patients with KRAS mutations and a history of smoking to study genetic and clinical patterns.*
- **Tumor evolution:** Examine how tumors change over time by analyzing multiple samples from the same patient. *For instance, you could investigate whether KRAS mutant tumors become more genetically unstable over time, thus potentially affecting survival.*
- **Immuno-genomics:** Study the relationship between genetic changes and immune-related features like tumor mutational burden or immune cell infiltration. *For example, you might explore if KRAS mutant tumors have a higher mutational burden, suggesting a more immune-responsive environment.*



## How do I prepare my data for upload into cBioportal?

### Before you begin
- Start by creating a folder to store all of your relevant study files. **The name of the folder must be the exact study ID that was provided to you by the cBioPortal team.** If any other name is provided, the automation steps will refuse upload since the altered study ID would not be on the list of approved values. The `cancer_study_identifier` value in your meta files should also be this same study ID. *Note: the study ID can be updated if desired, just reach out to the [Data Governance team](mailto:dataprotection@fredhutch.org) with your preferred ID.*
- Once your study files are close to complete, you can test out your file formatting using one of two validation methods:
    1. If you've received official approval for upload, try directly uploading it into the `fh-dasl-cbio` bucket. As mentioned above, the automated upload process will send you a validation report via email outlining any issues that may have popped up.
    2. You could also validate your study folder by [launching a local instance](https://github.com/FredHutch/cbioportal-data-formatting/tree/main/03_launch_local) of cBioPortal and troubleshooting the errors (if any) in your study data.

### Required/Optional Study Files
There are a few files that are required while all other files are optional. Below is an overview of the required files and some optional files *Note: Version 6 of cBioportal currently also requires in the least 1 non-clinical file to be uploaded as well. See instructions below on where to find a dummy table that you can modify in case you are only uploading clinical data.*
