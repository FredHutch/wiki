## 1. Intake

All Fred Hutch users must complete a **REDCap survey** to initiate the request. The survey must include:

- ✅ **Full name and email** of each user who needs access
- ✅ **Description** of the requested GENIE data (e.g., cancer types, release version)
- ✅ **Signed data use declaration** for each listed user

---

## 2. Notification

Upon survey submission:

- An automated notification is sent to 📧 `dataprotections@fredhutch.org`
- The request will be logged for review

---

## 3. Review Process

- The **Data Governance (DG) team** will review new requests within **3 business days**
- Incomplete or unclear submissions may require follow-up
- Once approved:
  - DG will notify the requestor via email
  - REDCap submission will be marked as **complete**
  - User access will be provisioned accordingly by the [cBioPortal team](https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C088E41ARV3)

## 4. Requesting Access for Additional Users

If you need to **add users** after the initial request:

- Return to the original REDCap form and **amend** the submission to include:
  - New user name(s) and email(s)
  - Data scope (if changed)
  - Signed declarations for each new user

The DG team will follow the same review steps listed above.
