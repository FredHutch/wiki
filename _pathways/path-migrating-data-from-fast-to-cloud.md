### Set Up Your Connection to Economy Cloud

Follow the steps documented [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/motuz/#add-a-new-cloud-connection-to-motuz) to create the connection to Economy Cloud.

### Copy Files

With a valid connection you can now [follow these steps](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/motuz/#copying-files-to-cloud-locations) to copy files from Fast or Temp into Economy Cloud.

> Motuz can copy files but **does not** delete files.  Deleting data from Fast or Temp is a separate process you would undertake after the copy is successful.
