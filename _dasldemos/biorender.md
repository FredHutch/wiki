[BioRender](https://www.biorender.com/) is a web application that creates scientific figures, illustrations, and diagrams. 
An institutional license for BioRender Premium is available for Fred Hutch employees and includes unlimited illustrations, thousands of individual icons, graphical assets, templates, and permissions for journal publications.

Below are some examples made by Fred Hutch researchers:

STEAP1 CAR T cells and CBD-IL-12 were combined to treat mCRPR in pre-clinical models of disease and shown to modestly decrease tumor size and slightly increase survival of mouse models while enhancing anti-tumor immune cell responses.

## Making Illustrations in the Web Interface

The Gallery the starting point for making and accessing files (illustrations, posters, graphs, etc). As an example, we will make a new illustration file by clicking on `+ Create new`,  then `Illustration`.

The left hand panel contains graphical assets that can used for your illustrations. There are over 5000 icons to use. Simply drag and drop an icon to the artboard to use in your illustration.
