# Getting Started with Data Science at Fred Hutch – A Cheat Sheet (Draft)

This is a **living document** designed to be a quick-reference **cheat sheet** for data science at Fred Hutch.  It’s not about writing new content but pointing to existing resources and identifying where new documentation is needed.  

### How You Can Contribute to This Article

This is meant to be a crowdsourced living guide to data science at Fred Hutch. If you’ve found a useful resource, written documentation, or know of something that should be linked here, please add it! Contributions don’t need to be polished—just drop in a link or note and others can refine it later.

Ways you can help:
- Add links to existing SciWiki pages, Centernet articles, or other Hutch resources.
- Suggest missing categories or topics that would make this index more complete (maybe report this as an issue for this page).
- Flag places where new documentation is needed so others can create it (maybe report this as an issue for this page).
- Share events, communities, or learning spaces that new researchers should know about.

Think of this as a cheat sheet for data science at the Hutch—every small contribution helps make it more useful for the next person.
