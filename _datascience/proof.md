## Introduction:

**PROOF** (PRoving cOmpute On cloud Foundations) is a user-friendly tool designed for managing and executing [**WDL**](https://docs.openwdl.org/en/1.0.0/) (Workflow Description Language) workflows using the [**Cromwell**](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow manager, configured to run on the [**Fred Hutch cluster**.](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/compute_jobs/) 

**PROOF** :

- Automates all the backend configurations necessary to run your workflows instantly.

- Allows researchers to validate, troubleshoot, assess performance, and run their workflows all under one roof.

- Also functions as a 'proofing' resource, enabling researchers to refine their workflows before potential transitions to cloud-based infrastructures.

This guide is intended to describe how you can run PROOF, catering to varying levels of computational expertise. 

We also have a WDL 101 course that will be a quick-start guide to building a WDL workflow.
