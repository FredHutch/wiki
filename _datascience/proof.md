**PROOF** (**PR**oduction **O**n-ramp for **O**ptimization and **F**easibility) is a user-friendly tool designed for managing and executing [**WDL**](https://docs.openwdl.org/en/1.0.0/) (Workflow Description Language) workflows using the [**Cromwell**](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow manager, configured to run on the [**Fred Hutch cluster**](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/compute_jobs/). PROOF allows users to:

- Automate all the backend configurations necessary to run your workflows instantly.

- Validate, troubleshoot, assess performance, and run their workflows all under one roof.

- Refine their workflows before potential transitions to cloud-based infrastructures, providing a 'proofing' resource of sorts.
