title: Data Classification

Data is a critically important and valuable asset to Fred Hutch. In
alignment with the current [Data Classification
Policy](https://fredhutch-fhccinstitutional.policystat.com/policy/14834959/latest/),
all information (data) at Fred Hutch should be categorized into one of
four categories based on the sensitivity/level of risk to help ensure
proper safeguards for handling and sharing of data.

The [Data Classification
guidance](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/u/data-science-lab/data-governance/data-classification.html)
provides some examples for each classification level, but it is
important to be aware that the examples provided are not exhaustive, and
some data may be classified differently at different times or may be
subject to specific information requirements under a contract or grant.
For this reason, you should reach out if you have any questions about
data classification or appropriate safeguards. The Data Science lab
(DaSL) can help navigate questions in this area along with domain
experts from information security, privacy, and legal. Contact

Call](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/programs/dhc.html).
