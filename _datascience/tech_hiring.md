Finding and recruiting talent for technical roles in a biomedical or scientific
institution can feel like a difficult task! The institutions are complex and the
technical roles are nuanced. Members of the Data Science Lab began to share
resources and best practices with each other, which evolved into pages on
the Biomedical Data Science Wiki. 

These pages are intended to provide guidance on hiring for technical positions,
such as data scientists, programmers, and bioinformaticians, in scientific
institutions like Fred Hutch Cancer Center. They draw on the personal
experience of staff and faculty in the Data Science Lab, and they are not
intended to be an authoritative or exhaustive resource. We've linked to other
sources, research, and evidence-based practices whenever possible. If you have
experience, links, or comments to add, please open a pull request or an issue on
this wiki .
