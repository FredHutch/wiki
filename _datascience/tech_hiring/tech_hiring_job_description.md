Recruitment starts when the hiring manager, with help from the recruiter, develops the job description for the position.

## Choosing a Job Title

The job title is the very first impression prospective applicants will have from
your job posting, therefore a clear, concise title that accurately reflects the 
position and corresponding responsibilities is essential. You may have seen
titles for tech roles that use flashy terms like 'ninja' or 'guru', but these 
can potentially discourage a broad array of applicants. A title such as 
'Data Science and Programming Specialist' maintains professional clarity and is 
more likely to resonate with a wide range of candidates, regardless of their 
gender, age, or cultural background.

## Job Summary

The job summary provides a snapshot of the role, and its relevance within your 
group. It should be succinct yet comprehensive enough to give potential 
applicants an understanding of the role. A brief welcoming statement that 
signals your organization's commitment to inclusivity can also be included 
here. For instance: 'As a team advancing scientific research, we welcome the 
applications of candidates from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, acknowledging the unique 
perspectives they bring.'

## Key Responsibilities

This section should include a detailed overview of the core duties and 
responsibilities associated with the role. This can include tasks such as 
developing algorithms, constructing data models, implementing code, etc. 
Language used in this section should remain gender-neutral and welcoming, 
making it clear that anyone with the requisite skills and experience is 
encouraged to apply. Avoid the use of extreme modifiers or superlatives that 
might discourage applicants who do not meet every single requirement. Remember, 
potential and willingness to learn can be just as valuable as existing 
knowledge.

## Qualifications and Skills

The qualifications and skills section needs to clearly differentiate between 
required and preferred skills. An applicant with a strong foundation in 
Python and SQL, for instance, might be ideal, but familiarity with machine 
learning algorithms could be listed as a bonus rather than a necessity. This 
distinction invites a broader range of applicants, including those who might 
not yet have acquired all the preferred skills but show strong potential and 
enthusiasm for learning.

## Inclusive Language

Language plays an important role in conveying your willing to support any 
qualified candidate. Avoid gendered pronouns or terminology that could exclude 
certain groups. Utilize inclusive pronouns such as 'they' and 'their' rather 
than 'he' or 'she' and 'his' or 'her'. This helps to ensure that all potential 
candidates feel welcomed to apply.

## Group Culture and Values

This section offers an opportunity to showcase your team's culture, mission, 
and values. An honest articulation of these aspects helps potential applicants 
understand the kind of environment they will be stepping into. For example, you 
might say: 'We are a diverse team of researchers committed to fostering an 
inclusive environment, where everyone's voice is heard, respected, and valued. 
Our mission is to advance scientific research by harnessing the power of our 
collective expertise.'
