Before crafting the interview questions, you need to have a clear understanding 
of the role you are hiring for. Is this a pure programming role, a data science 
position, or a hybrid? Will the individual work closely with a team or in a 
more isolated capacity? What are the tools, programming languages, and systems 
this role will involve? If it is a data science role, what kind of data will 
they be handling? Are there any specific machine learning models or statistical 
techniques they should be familiar with?

Once you have a good grasp of the job description, this can be translated into 
a set of skills and competencies that the ideal candidate should have. The job
description should therefore inform the questions that directly 
relate to the day-to-day tasks the candidate will be undertaking.

## Technical Questions

Technical questions are an opportunity to assess a candidate's knowledge and 
proficiency in relevant areas such as data analysis, programming languages, or 
algorithm development. While creating these questions, avoid making them so 
overly complex that they deter capable candidates who may excel in real-world 
scenarios, as opposed to interviews where candidates put undue pressure on
themselves. For example, instead of asking them to write a complex algorithm on 
the spot, consider presenting a scenario or problem that they might encounter 
on the job and ask how they would approach it.

## Problem-Solving Questions

These questions allow you to evaluate a candidate's ability to think critically 
and solve problems. Questions could involve situational problems or hypothetical
challenges related to the role. For example: "Can you describe a time when you 
had to troubleshoot a coding issue? What steps did you take to resolve it?"

## Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions offer insights into a candidate's interpersonal skills, 
adaptability, and potential cultural fit within the team. Questions can be 
designed to gauge their approach to collaboration, conflict resolution, or 
managing work under pressure. For instance: "Can you share an instance when you 
had to navigate a disagreement within your team?" Fred Hutch's recruitment team

It's also crucial not to overlook the importance of social skills. Computer 
programmers and data scientists often work in teams, so skills like 
communication, problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability are often just
as important as technical skills. Consider including situational or behavioral 
questions that can help assess these soft skills. For instance, you might ask 
the candidate to describe a time when they had to explain a complex technical 
concept to a colleague.

## Appropriate Question Pacing

Start with simpler questions to make the candidate comfortable and to assess 
their foundational knowledge. As the interview progresses, gradually increase 
the complexity of the questions. Complex questions can not only test the depth 
of the candidate's knowledge and their problem-solving ability, but also their 
resilience and how they perform under pressure.

Make sure the questions are relevant to the job role and not tricky for the 
sake of being tricky. Remember, the goal is to understand if the candidate can 
perform the job, not to make them stumble.

Remember to allow room for creativity and independent thinking in your 
questions. The way a candidate approaches a problem can be just as insightful 
as whether they get the 'correct' answer.

## Inclusive Questioning

Asking about candidates' experiences with diversity, equity, and inclusion can 
emphasize the importance of these values in your organization. Questions like, 
"Can you describe how you've contributed to fostering an inclusive environment 
in your previous roles?" can provide useful insights.

## Future-Oriented Questions

These questions can help you understand a candidate's growth potential, 
ambitions, and longevity with your organization. For instance, you could ask: 
"How do you hope to grow in this role, and what skills are you looking to 
develop further?"

## Providing Room for Questions

Always provide candidates with the opportunity to ask their own questions. This 
not only allows them to clarify any doubts but also demonstrates their interest 
and engagement. It's essential to answer these questions honestly to ensure 
clarity and mutual understanding.

## Respectful and Equitable Interviews

Remember, an interview is a two-way process and a candidate's first real insight 
into your group. Keep the conversation respectful and encourage open, candid 
responses. Show genuine interest in the candidate's responses and avoid any 
unconscious biases that might impact your evaluation. 

## Be Consistent

Don't wing it! Approach the interview process scientifically by asking the same
questions in the same order across candidates. These questions
should be based on the core competencies that you've outlined for the role.
Focus on the questions you've outlined, but don't hesitate to ask follow-up
questions and go into more depth. 

## Developing Questions Outside Your Area of Expertise

If you are looking to hire for technical skills outside of your expertise,
you'll need to consult with technical colleagues to help evaluate candidates.
However, you can still develop questions given your knowledge of the problems
you're trying to solve with this hire. For example:

1. Write down a question you want answered (not technical yet), such as: *"how
   many patients are on treatment x."*
2. Ask the candidate to describe how they would answer that question if the data
   were available to them in a file, database, or a website. 
3. Reach out to someone with technical expertise to evaluate whether it is a
   good answer.
