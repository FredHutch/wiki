Recruiters will have access to the job description that is posted, but any
additional context for the types of skills, experience or interests that would
most interest you in a candidate is valuable to share.  Think about how many
different roles, especially at a hybrid medical center and academic institute,
the same HR department recruits for, then think about how much domain specific
knowledge would be required in how many domains for them to be able to
confidently assess what a "good" candidate looks like for any given hire.  

Think about the top 1-2 features that would be of most interest to learn about a
candidate that would provide some insight into the domain-specific requirements.
How would a non-technical recruiter evaluate, at least generally, a candidate in
an informative way?  Blending that insight with all the expertise of a recruiter
can create a very effective team to identify good candidates for your position.  

One somewhat unique challenge for evaluating candidates in data and programming
oriented technical roles is the trend that candidates with data science,
research software development and other data analysis skill sets are more often
obtaining skills through non-degree granting educational opportunities, or
during seemingly un-related job experiences (e.g. a laboratory technician who's
learned R programming on the job to analyze the data they generate).  With the
rise of self-taught candidates, being able to assess those candidates fairly and
with the recognition that it takes quite a bit of drive and motivation that may
not immediately come across on a resume, will help you avoid weeding out
excellent candidates.

## Provide Guidance for Recruiters
Hiring Managers can be proactive about supporting their recruiting team for
hiring technical roles.  These are some specific suggestions for after a job
posting has been approved that can help.  Keep in mind that often data science
jobs are in high demand, and the response rate of positions in that area can be
quite high.  

### Screening Resumes
- Highlight the most important aspects of the candidate's experience, or
  qualifications to the person doing screening of the resumes that are
  submitted. 

- Provide a list of skills, interests or experience types that would perhaps not
  be listed explicitly on the job posting but candidates who have them would be
  likely to be successful in the position.  

- Candidates will be required to meet the minimum requirements, but additional
  insight into the less tangible aspects you value most in a candidate can help
  prevent screening out of good candidates and enriching your pool for the most
  interesting candidates.  Examples include: 
    - We would accept someone with less years of experience if they had specific
      experience working with a specific data type or in a particular context
      (like prior experience at a research or medical institution).  
    - Related job certifications might be nice to have, but would value
      experience over a certificate if given the choice.  
    - One or two specific desired skills that are most valuable. 

An interesting [article about hiring Clinical Research
Coordinators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8889228/) in an
academic center much like Fred Hutch documents some considerations into how this
process can be challenging or improved.  This article provides some useful
context for what is going on on the recruiter side of the experience that might
influence how you approach hiring in general, and most especially for technical
roles. 

### Phone Screens

Recruiters will primarily focus on some of the most critical, but non-technical,
aspects of whether a candidate might be a good fit for the role during the phone
screen.  This may include some fairly standard questions about the candidate and
questions such as why they are interested in the role or what they are looking
for in their next position.  To make this time invested most effective, it can
be helpful to have some questions tailored to the role itself.  

Provide the person doing initial phone screening of candidates some questions to
ask during that screen that are non-technical but get at the 1-2 most critical
aspects of the position. Giving some suggestions for what you'd consider an
"interesting" candidate might answer versus an "uninteresting" candidate is
valuable too.  

This is a good place to ask questions that get at interests beyond their
experience and also workstyle or workplace culture which are less likely to be
reflected on their resumes.  Questions about long term career goals or reasons
why they applied to the position can give hints toward whether the trajectory of
the role you have in mind matches what they are looking for, which can result in
a better fit.

Assessing whether to move a candidate forward based on the results of a phone
screen should be done, as mentioned, as consistently as possible across all
applicants.  Describing for yourself what constitutes a "good" or "neutral" or
"bad" phone screen tailored to the specific position and described prior to
receiving any phone screen results helps to reduce bias and help you be
efficient.
