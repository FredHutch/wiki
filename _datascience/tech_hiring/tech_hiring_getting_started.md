At sizeable biomedical medical and academic research institutes like Fred Hutch,
there are a wide range of roles that are being processed and supported by HR
department at any given time.  Knowing how you can best engage with the support
provided by your institution and what aspects of the process you need to take
ownership of will help you make finding and hiring into your group much more
productive.  

[Here's](https://aiden-dataminer.medium.com/data-science-interviews-50f52b9359da)
an example of a data science oriented description of the overall process of
hiring. Much of these processes and issues are also relevant for Fred Hutch
hires. An initial process to publicize the position, collect and review resumes
to screen applicants often happens in collaboration with your recruiting
department if your organization has one. However, developing the approach and
process to the subsequent technical parts of the screening and hiring process
for your own group to help you screen and hire for technical data, programming,
and scientific roles will be primarily your responsibility.
