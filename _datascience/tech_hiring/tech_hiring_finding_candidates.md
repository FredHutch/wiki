Recruiting programmers and data scientists can require going beyond just writing
a job description and posting it online. Below we describe some alternative ways
you can find qualified candidates.

### Tech and Data Science Conferences

Tech and data science conferences are great places to find passionate 
folks who are interested in current trends in their field. Consider attending
even if the event is virtual, as these events often feature candidates who are
showcasing their work. Conferences usually include structured networking events,
and these events can be great opportunities for meeting potential candidates
who are looking for work. 

### Online Communities and Forums

Online communities like GitHub, Stack Overflow, Kaggle, and Hugging Face are 
places where programmers and data scientists congregate to discuss, share, and 
work on projects. These platforms allow you to see a potential candidate's 
portfolio of work, their problem-solving skills, and their engagement with their
larger professional community. Some communities also have dedicated Slack Workspaces 
with career channels.

### Professional Networking Events and Meetups

Consider attending professional networking events, tech meetups, or local coding
groups. Sites like Meetup.com can help you find relevant gatherings in your 
area. These can be great opportunities to meet professionals who might be open 
to new opportunities.

### Employee Referrals

Don't forget to ask your existing team in anyone in their networks might be a
good fit for the position. Folks in your current group likely have professional 
networks of their own, and they may be able to recommend qualified colleagues 
for your open position.

To get technical referrals through the networks of your colleagues who are technical, you'll need to:

- Have good relationships with technical colleagues
- Have them look at your job post before you post it for obvious issues
- Ask them to share with their networks

## Workplace Culture and Recruitment

Getting good technical candidates requires having a good reputation with having technical people. How do you get a good reputation with technical people? You can:

1. Support their careers
2. Understand and support how they work
3. Make them feel valued
4. Advertise their work
5. Cheerlead when they move on 

Another way to start is by writing down and sharing your lab culture, philosophy, and values.
