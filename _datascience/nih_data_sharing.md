Starting January 25th, 2023, the NIH implemented a new policy that requires new grant applications or renewals that generate scientific data to include a detailed data management and sharing plan. The NIH expects all shareable data to be made available, whether it is associated with a publication or not. The goals of this new policy are to establish the expectation for the management and sharing of scientific data generated from NIH-funded or conducted research, and to emphasize the importance of good data management practices.

You can learn more about "FAIR" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data sharing [principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) at the [FAIRSharing site](https://fairsharing.org/) which has a catalogue of data preservation, management and sharing policies form international funding agencies, regulators and journals and a lot of other information about data standards.  

You can find more information about specific [data repositories](/execute_sharing/) you may consider using to comply with the NIH Data Sharing requirements.  

## DMPtool.org
In response to this new, expanded scope of data sharing requirements as well as from other funding agencies, the Data Science Lab has begun customizing [dmptool.org](https://dmptool.org/) for Fred Hutch investigators.  You can learn more about this free tool on our [dmptool page](/datademos/dmptool/).

## NIH Data Sharing Guide
The Data Science Lab has also created a guide you can [find here](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/) that walks you through the process of complying with the new 2023 NIH Data Sharing Policy. 
>If you take this course and want to give us feedback or would like to learn more about it, you can share your thoughts in [the FH Data Slack in the #ask-dasl channel](https://fhdata.slack.com/archives/C043ZVCBY9Z)) or you can file an issue on [the course's GitHub repository](https://github.com/fhdsl/NIH_Data_Sharing).


### What does this policy change mean for me?
The major requirement of the policy is that all grant proposals (submitted after January 25th, 2023) for mechanisms that require compliance, must include a plan for how they will manage and share their data. 

For certain grant mechanisms for projects that do not generate data, compliance with the policy is not required. For certain types of data, sharing is not possible, and a justification will be required instead. 



## Does the Policy Apply?

The DMS Policy applies to all research that generates scientific data, including:

- Research Projects (R)
- Some Career Development Awards (K)
- Small Business SBIR/STTR 
- Research Centers

The DMS Policy does not apply to research and other activities that do not generate scientific data, including:

- Training (T)
- Fellowships (F)
- Construction (C06)
- Conference Grants (R13)
- Resource (G)
- Research-Related Infrastructure Programs (e.g., S06) 

To determine if your research requires compliance with other policies that may influence how you share your data, take this [quiz](https://sharing.nih.gov/other-sharing-policies/which-policies-apply-to-my-research).

> Does my research generate scientific data?

The NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy applies to **all NIH-supported research generating scientific data**. But what is considered "scientific data"?

Scientific data are the “recorded factual material of sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings, regardless of whether the data are used to support scholarly publications”. This can include any of the following if they are applicable to your study:

- unpublished results
- null results
- results used to publish papers

You are not expected to share:

- lab notebooks
- preliminary analyses
- case report forms
- drafts of scientific papers
- plans for future research
- peer reviews
- communications with colleagues
- physical objects (such as biospecimens)

## Essential Components of a DMS Plan
We outline these essential components in more depth in our DaSL developed resources described below, however there are 6 elements that will be required in your data management plan.  


1. **Data type** - describe what data (amount and type) will be generated over the course of funding and what data will or will not be shared
2. **Tools, software, and code** - describe in what tools you intend to use to manage and analyze the data (note code is not required to be shared)
3. **Standards** - describe any standards that you might need to use for your data and metadata to make them usable by others or be contributed to a repository
4. **Data preservation, access, timelines** - describe where the data will be made available and when
5. **Access, distribution, reuse considerations** - describe how you have carefully considered any reasons that might limit sharing
6. **Oversight** - describe who will manage compliance of the DMS plan (likely a member of your group)
