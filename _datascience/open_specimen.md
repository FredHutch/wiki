[OpenSpecimen](https://www.openspecimen.org/) is a highly configurable web-based biobanking laboratory information management system (LIMS) used in 70+ clinical research centers across 20+ countries - including many of the world’s leading research centers. OpenSpecimen helps you collect high-quality biospecimen data and track biospecimens from collection to utilization.

[The Office of Translational Research](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/institutes-networks-ircs/seattle-translational-tumor-research.html) (OTR) manages OpenSpecimen at Fred Hutch and provides access to all investigators at Fred Hutch, University of Washington or Seattle Children’s. To learn more about users of OpenSpecimen and the groups served, visit our [SmartSheet Dashboard](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=fb4ed82182e8416d8650aaaed1bc4adc).

To request a demo, contact OTR at `SpecimenData@fredhutch.org`.

OTR works with each group to understand their unique specimen management needs and walk them through the onboarding process. Interested users should submit an intake request through the [OpenSpecimen sign-up](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/65d566e3d88b46a990b1f03eb64abc99).

The time to go-live for each group varies based on several identified factors, however, it can be estimated fairly well if all data and needs are clearly shared by the group during the initial intake meeting.
