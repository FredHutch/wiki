[**cBioPortal**](https://www.cbioportal.org/) is an open-access, open-source resource for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). The Data Science Lab (DaSL) in conjunction with the Scientific Computing Group (SciComp) at Fred Hutch have integrated a Fred Hutch instance of cBioPortal for research use only. 

The [Fred Hutch deployment of cBioPortal](https://cbioportal.fredhutch.org/) provides:

- **Interim Visualization**: The Fred Hutch instance of cBioPortal allows for the visualization of clinical and genomic data both published and unpublished.
- **Facilitated Sharing**: Hosting your data enables sharing and comparison to other datasets from the Fred Hutch community and beyond.
- **Controlled Access**: Study data is restricted to authorized personnel approved by the study lead or principal investigator (PI), thus protecting your research data
- **Inclusion of Sensitive Data**: cBioportal has been reviewed and approved by InfoSec to include up to individually identifiable research data.
