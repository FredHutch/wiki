[**cBioPortal**](https://www.cbioportal.org/) is an open-access, open-source resource for interactive exploration of multidimensional cancer genomics data sets developed by Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). The Data Science Lab (DaSL) in conjunction with the Scientific Computing Group (SciComp) at Fred Hutch have integrated a Fred Hutch instance of cBioPortal for research use only. 

The Fred Hutch deployment of cBioPortal provides:

- **Interim Visualization**: The FH instance of cBioPortal allows for the visualization of clinical and genomic data both published and unpublished.

- **Facilitated Sharing**: Hosting your data enables easier sharing and comparison of to other datasets from the FH community and beyond.

- **Controlled Access**: Study data is restricted to authorized personnel approved by the study lead or principal investigator (PI), thus protecting your research data

- **Security Approval**: The FH cBioPortal is a secure storage solution, reviewed and approved by the Fred Hutch Information Security Team.

-**Inclusion of Sensitive Data**: The secure nature of the portal allows for the inclusion of individually identifying research data, such as Personal Health Information (PHI), if covered by the studyâ€™s IRB.
