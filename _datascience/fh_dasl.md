title: Data Science Training & Community - The Fred Hutch Data Science Lab
---

The [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/) is here to support your journey in data science! We provide training, resources, and a welcoming community to help researchers, students, and professionals build their skills. Through a collaboration between FH-DaSL, the [Office of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO) at Fred Hutch](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/), and experts in biomedical data science, we create accessible learning opportunities that apply across many scientific fields. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand your expertise, our programs are designed to make data science education engaging and impactful.

The FH-DaSL offers multiple ways for learners to build and strengthen their data science skills:

## [Community-based training](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/community/)

Our community-based training programs provide hands-on learning through instructor-led [courses](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/courses/) and [workshops](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/classes-workshops/#data-4-all) , covering a wide range of topics for learners of all backgrounds.

We also foster Learning Communities, where participants can collaborate, share expertise, and support each other in a co-working environment. Plus, we host interactive events like Code-a-thons and Doc-a-thons, giving learners the chance to apply their skills, tackle real-world problems, and push their knowledge further in a fun, supportive setting!

## [Self-directed Training](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/teach-yourself/)

We also provide self-directed learning materials beyond this [SciWiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) which includes [self-paced courses](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/classes-workshops/) and [Data Snacks](https://hutchdatascience.org/data_snacks/) that demonstrate application-oriented examples. These resources allow learners to explore data science concepts at their own pace, making it easy to build skills anytime, anywhere.
