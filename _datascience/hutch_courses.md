The Fred Hutch Data Science Lab's wider training efforts can be found on our [training page](https://hutchdatascience.org/training/).  However, in addition to data science training courses we create that are focused on a wider audience, we have also created a number of Fred Hutch oriented training materials.  

Course Name | Description | Link(s)
---|---|---
[Cluster 101](/datascience/hutch_courses/#cluster-101) | Intro to using the Fred Hutch HPC cluster for new or experienced users. Provides a certification option. | [With Certification](https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101) or [Without Certification](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_101/)
[WDL 101](/datascience/hutch_courses/#wdl-101) | Intro to using Cromwell to run WDL workflows at the Fred Hutch | [Course link](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_WDL101_Cromwell/)
[Code Review](/datascience/hutch_courses/#code-review) | Leading a lab with novice or experienced code writers and users?  Either way, our Code Review guidance materials include helpful suggestions for various types of lab members, expertise and group dynamics.  | [Course Link](https://hutchdatascience.org/code_review/)
[NIH Data Sharing](/datascience/hutch_courses/#nih-data-sharing) | We have created and are actively developing a guide that walks you through the process of complying with the new 2023 NIH Data Sharing Policy.  | [Guide Link](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/)


## Cluster 101
We collaborated with SciComp and created a course called Cluster 101, to introduce new and experienced high performance computing users to the Fred Hutch cluster.  This course can be taken anytime, anywhere, for free (don't worry just set the LeanPub cost to zero) and itâ€™ll help you check to make sure your account is set up to use the cluster and either help you check to make sure you understand the basics of how to use a cluster, or help you get up to speed.  It can even give you a certification for reporting between staff and lab leaders if need be.  

- If you need/want to get a certification, please take the course through Leanpub at [this link](https://leanpub.com/courses/fredhutch/fredhutchcluster101).  


- If you do not need the certification or want to bookmark the course for future reference, you can find the material at [this link](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_101/).

## WDL 101

Our next emerging guide is [WDL 101:  Using Cromwell at the Fred Hutch](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_WDL101_Cromwell/) which will help users leverage our pre-configured software to allow you to run and manage all of your computing jobs, as well as run workflows written in WDL (a widely used open specification for workflow description), even if they use Docker containers! This is an excellent tool for researchers who do not use large scale computing resources often or who would want a method to simply upload a file and use a website to submit jobs to the cluster. Also, for researchers who do leverage amount of cluster resources, this approach can help you make your computing more efficient, help you to scale up your pleasantly parallel work and shift to using containers and structuring tasks appropriately to facilitate moving to the cloud when needed.  This guide is under active development as of Nov 2022.

## Code Review
Leading a lab with novice or experienced code writers and users?  Either way, see our [Code Review](https://hutchdatascience.org/code_review/) materials that include helpful suggestions for various types of lab members, expertise and group dynamics.

## NIH Data Sharing
We have created and are actively developing a guide you can [find here](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/) that walks you through the process of complying with the new 2023 NIH Data Sharing Policy.
