Welcome to the Hutch!  Here are a few community resources to help with your computational needs as you get started with using computing resources here. 

## Online Communities

This Slack workspace is a place for Hutch researchers to ask questions, get updates, and build community.  Only your @fredhutch.org email address is required (no invitation necessary), and this space is also open to members of the Consortium (UW and Children's). Check out the various channels for topic-specific resources, peer to peer support and staying updated on current events.

## Support Organizations and Where to Find Them

These groups can help you identify and use compute resources at the Hutch:

[Scientific Computing (SciComp)](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/scicomp.html)
Fred Hutch's [Data Science Lab (DaSL)](https://hutchdatascience.org/)
[IT Service Desk](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk.html)

## Events and Meetings

Got questions on managing, using, and analysing data?  [Data House Calls](https://hutchdatascience.org/datahousecalls/) may be for you!  Schedule some time with the Data Science team to discuss your specific needs on a variety of data oriented topics from NIH data sharing plans to writing code or doing data analysis. 

Drop in [Effective Computing](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7128526d3409428c969260d7dcce2f6b%40thread.skype/Effective%2520Computing%2520Drop%2520In?groupId=1b968d63-dc19-460f-9e6d-cdbd539d1bc6&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) is a biweekly Teams meeting where DaSL, Scientific Computing and Data Core team members are available to help you effectively use the computational and data resources at the Hutch to make your computing more effective, regardless of the scale. 

Drop in [SciComp Office hours](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3abe85aa58c3624fb79c1590342ec75c63%40thread.skype/DaSL%2520Data%2520House%2520Calls?groupId=1b968d63-dc19-460f-9e6d-cdbd539d1bc6&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) is a weekly Teams meeting where the members of Scientific Computing are available to help with your research computing needs.

## Documentation

The [SciWiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) is a community maintained wiki that with documentation on:
 - using compute resources and computational tools
 - generating and analysing data
 

## Training Resources

The [Intro to Fred Hutch Cluster Computing](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_101/index.html) training course is good for those new to cluster computing as well as those new to the Hutch's computing infrastructure.
The [pathways](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/pathways/) section of the wiki contains step-by-step instructions on specific series of tasks that are commonly strung together.
