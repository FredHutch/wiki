## What is Apptainer

**Note**: {% glossary Apptainer %} was formerly known as {% glossary Singularity %}.

From `apptainer.org`'s [introduction](http://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/):

> Apptainer is a *container* platform. It allows you to create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and reproducible. You can build a container using Apptainer on your laptop, and then run it on many of the largest HPC clusters in the world, local university or company clusters, a single server, in the cloud, or on a workstation down the hall. Your container is a single file, and you donâ€™t have to worry about how to install all the software you need on each different operating system and system.

[Apptainer] allows us to run containers- including Docker containers- on our shared systems.  Docker requires a number of adminstrative privileges which makes it unusable in shared multi-user environments with networked storage.  [Apptainer] remedies these problems allowing individual, non-root, users to run containers.

Apptainer is maintained and deployed in our environment using environment modules (lmod).  You will need to load this module before running any commands.

## Using Apptainer

> Apptainer is available on the rhino and gizmo compute hosts.  Please use a gizmo node if your task will be computationally intensive.  Apptainer containers can be run interactively (via grabnode) and in batch processing

Apptainer is a module- load it with `ml`:

```ShellSession
$ ml Apptainer
```

Use `ml spider` to see available versions.  You can download ("pull") any Docker image and it will be converted to Apptainer format:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer pull docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow

## Using Docker Containers with Apptainer

As indicated earlier, Apptainer can run Docker container images.  However, Docker container images must first be converted to be usable by Apptainer.

> The conversion step is only necessary the first time you convert a Docker container to a Apptainer container or when you want to update your Apptainer container (e.g. to a newer version of a Docker container).

### Example - Convert and Run latest R Docker container with Apptainer

This example converts an Apptainer container named _r-base-latest_ from the official R Docker container and starts an interactive R session with that container

```ShellSession
$ ml Apptainer
$ apptainer build r-base-latest.sif docker://r-base

You can run an R script directly in the container with:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer exec r-base-latest.sif Rscript script.R
```

## Container Customization

Containers can be customized by using a base container image, then adding desired changes via a "definition file" which has necessary steps for modifying the base container.

Root access is typically required to build Apptainer containers.  Sylabs' remote builder provides an option to build your container in Sylabs' sandbox cloud infrastructure. Once the container finishes building it will be automatically download to your working directory where it can be run.

To use the remote builder option in Apptainer you need a Sylabs account and key. The steps to set up remote builder can be found [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/endpoint.html)

> You will need to generate a new key every 30 days when using Sylabs' remote builder option.

### Example: Add R Libraries to the Base Container

In this example, we are going to build a more complex Apptainer container using the latest R Docker image.  To the base container we will add additional R modules using a Apptainer definition file and then build using Sylabs' tools.

#### Create a Definition File.

Create a definition file named `my.r.apptainer.build.def` containing:

```Apptainer
BootStrap: docker
From: r-base

%post
R --no-echo -e 'install.packages("devtools", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
```

This file indicates that `docker` is used to build the container from a Docker image named `r-base`.  The `%post` section defines the steps we want to take to modify that original container- in this case using R to install the _devtools_ package.

More information about Apptainer definition files is available [here.](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/quick_start.html#apptainer-definition-files) 

#### Build

The build is similar to the earlier example, but instead of providing a remote image name, we point `apptainer` to the definition file and indicate that the container will be built remotely:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer build --remote my_r_container.sif my.r.apptainer.build.def
```

#### Verify

If we launch the R editor on our new Apptainer container with the following command.

```ShellSession
$ apptainer exec my_r_container.sif R
```

And then check all of the user installed R packages with the following command.

```
ip <- as.data.frame(installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)])
rownames(ip) <- NULL
ip <- ip[is.na(ip$Priority),1:2,drop=FALSE]
print(ip, row.names=FALSE)
```

We can now see all of the newly installed R libraries. There are two R libraries in the base R Docker container- now you should see many more than that.

## Access to Storage

Storage on the host where you are running the container can be made available via a bind command into the container.  Many local paths are bound into the container by default.  For example, the current working directory and your home are available in the container by default.

> When I indicate "local path" I am including network paths _mounted_ locally- so even though fast and scratch are not technically local to the host, they appear local.

If you need access to other storage paths (e.g. `/fh/scratch`, `/fh/fast`) you will need to provide mount points (directories) in the container and explicitly bind paths to those mount points that as part of running the container.  Note that your HutchNet ID will need permissions to this storage, but root privileges are not necessary.

### Example: Bind Local File Systems

In this example we'll make the `biodata` files maintained by Shared Resources available in our container on the path `/mnt/data`.

#### Create Mount Points

Modify the definition file we created earlier (`my.r.apptainer.build.def`), adding a command to the `%post` section to create the directory where we will mount biodata:

```Apptainer
BootStrap: docker
From: r-base

%post
R --no-echo -e 'install.packages("devtools", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
mkdir -p /mnt/data
```

#### Rebuild

Rebuild the container as above:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer build --remote my_r_container.sif my.r.apptainer.build.def
```

#### Run with Bind

Once the container has been rebuilt we just need to run the container as earlier, but adding additional instructions to bind the local path (on the host where you are running Apptainer) to the directory we created.

There are two ways to bind these paths into the container- on the command line:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer exec --bind /shared/biodata:/mnt/data my_r_container.sif R
```

or via environment variables:

```ShellSession
$ export APPTAINER_BIND=/shared/biodata:/mnt/data
$ apptainer exec my_r_container.sif R
```

#### Verify

You can verify the bind of those paths with `shell`. Start a shell in the container and run:

```ShellSession
$ export APPTAINER_BIND=/shared/biodata:/mnt/data
$ apptainer shell my_r_container.sif

Apptainer> ls /mnt/data
example_data  gmap-gsnap  humandb  microbiome  ncbi-blast  ngs	seq  tmp
```

## The Build Environment

### The Image Cache

Apptainer caches data to speed future operations.  By default the cache is in your home directory, in a directory named `.apptainer`.  This cache can be moved depending on your need- this can be controlled with the environment variable `APPTAINER_CACHEDIR`.

```ShellSession
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=${HOME}/.my_cachedir
$ apptainer build my.r.apptainer.build.def
```

Note that you will need to set this environment variable every time you wish to use this cache path.

### Build Temporary Files

Two environment variables (and one command-line option) can be used to control where the build is done.  This includes extraction of the various downloads and other build steps necessary to create the container.

The command line option `--tmpdir` takes precedence over the environment variables:

```ShellSession
$ apptainer build --tmpdir=${HOME}/tmp my.r.apptainer.build.def
```

The environment variables `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` and `TMPDIR` are used if the command line option isn't set.  `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` takes precedence over `TMPDIR`.

>IMPORTANT:  If you set this build directory path to a location in the Scratch file system you may encounter errors like "operation not permitted" when building the container.  This file system does not support file operations used by some container builds (e.g. hard links and some attributes).
