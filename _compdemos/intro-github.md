## What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a code hosting platform meant to be used for version control and collaboration.
- It is a place where researchers can upload and share their code and data related to manuscripts
  - link some sample repos?
- GitHub requires a specific workflow and uses some jargon that may be new to you! It can be overwhelming at first. 
  - Before diving into any code get familiar with GitHub terms and workflow by reading [this document](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Data management

- GitHub is set up so that all data and code related to a single project live in the same repository.
- On your own personal computer, you will need to create a directory.
  - This can go anywhere on your local computer
  - This directory will become the repository
  - A basic repository structure might look like:
    - `README.md`: A document in markdown containing an overview of the software.
    - `data-raw/`: A directory containing raw, unprocessed data
    - `data/`
    - `code/`

## Getting started
