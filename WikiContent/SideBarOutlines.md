# Bioinformatics Domain Sidebar Outline: 

## Genomics Analysis Approaches
### Overview
These are common workflows/examples of tools used and best practices when/if applicable for a given approach.  Additionally these sections include links to publications, web-based resources and/or on-campus experts should they choose to be included.  
### Variant Calling and Analysis
### Gene Expression and Transcript Analysis
### Microbiome Analysis and Microbial Genomics
### GWAS

## Pipelining and Workflows
### Overview
When executing computational analyses it can be difficult to keep track of what
analyses have been run, with what parameters, and on what files. In order to keep
track of this information and make it easier to reproduce your results, people
often turn to computational tools for "pipelines" and "workflows." In this section
we address the relative merits of a range tools that are used for pipelines and workflows.
### Docker
### Globus - tied to AWS
### Shell Scripting / Bash
### AWS Batch
### Other Cloud Compute Options (Azure, etc)
### Sciluigi
### Other Common Workflow Systems
#### Toil
#### SCONS
#### Snakemake


## Computing Platforms
### Overview
Sometimes the most basic question for computational analysis is "what computer can
I use to run my code?" In this section we briefly describe a range of options, all
the way from a single laptop to the FH on prem cluster (`gizmo`), to various "cloud"
options, with a brief description and links for further onramping materials.
### Low Compute Resources
### Intermediate Compute Resources
### High Compute Resources
#### Serverless (since this isn't really a pipelining-specific topic but rather an HPC topic)



# Computing Domain Sidebar Outline:

## Access Points

## Data Storage and Access
### Overview
Costs and basics for researchers to know
### On Prem Storage
What are the systems, how are they backed up, how do you access them, PHI or no?, what compute resources connect to these storage locations and how?
### Cloud Storage
What are the systems, how are they backed up, how do you access them, PHI or no?, what compute resources connect to these storage locations and how?
