Scientific Computing (SciComp) provides computational resources and services
for Fred Hutch researchers.  These links will take you to overview and
introductory materials about those resources and services.

## [Resources Available](/computing/resource_overview/)

The basic list of what SciComp provides and supports.  Start here to see if
we've already built it.

## [Getting Access to SciComp Resources](/computing/access_overview/)

Now that you know what and where, how do you get to these resources?  This page
willdescribe what you need to access and use the various resources.

## [Storing and Using Data](/computing/store_overview/)

Data is our lifeblood: this describes all of the options (traditional and new)
for storing and using data and shows how you might choose the best place to
keep it.

## [HPC Resource Overview](/computing/cluster_overview/)

This describes in the high performance computing options provided by Scientific Computing.  There's a number of different resources- this will help you find the appropriate one for your work.

## [Scientific Software and Tools](/computing/software_overview/)

Computers are no good without software- SciComp maintains a huge trove of
software for our research.  This page describes how you can find, use, and
build software in our environment.

## [Consulting and Training](/computing/training_overview/)

In addition to this documentation, there are many options for getting help with
your work.  There are training and consulting options ranging from basic to
advanced skills and from general computing to specialized- domain specific-
topics
