### Mac Terminal and X11
#### Terminal
The default Mac terminal is a good choice for connecting to and using SciComp Linux-based resources. If you are using to using the features of screen I would recommend using (iTerm2)[https://www.iterm2.com/] for your local terminal program on your Mac.  iTerm2 is fully integrated with tmux. Tmux provides most of the same features as GNU Screen.  Run tmux from one of the Linux session servers like lynx, manx, sphinx.
 -  ```module load tmux``` 

#### X11 for Mac
The only X11 client for Mac is XQuartz. Install XQuartz before running any Linux X11 apps such as rstudio or matlab. Go to http://xquartz.macosforge.org, and download and install the latest version of XQuartz. 

After installing XQuartz just start the app. The XQuartz icon will appear in the toolbar showing that it is running. XQuartz is now running an X11 client and that is the only interaction that you need to do with XQuartz. After XQuartz is running, open the Mac terminal. The latest version of XQuartz sets the DISPLAY environment with the default Mac terminal window.  I do not recommend using the terminal that comes with XQuartz.

When connecting to a rhino with ssh always use the -X flag to forward your Xsession to your Mac.

```ssh -X jfdey@rhino2```
After connecting to a Rhino verify that your X11 client is working by typing ```xeyes```.
