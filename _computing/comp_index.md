Center IT supports a wide array of resources made available to researchers.  Much of the basic desktop computing information needed on an ongoing basis can be found via Centernet and the Center IT pages.  However, much of the scientific computing resource documentation beyond this material is provided in this section of the Wiki, and links to existing resources and documentation (internally or externally created) are provided when available.  This site is intended as a hub to link users to the documentation they need for the various tools and processes in use at the Fred Hutch.  While we streamline and optimize this site, remember to use our search capability if you feel that you cannot find what you are looking for yet.  When in doubt, please drop `scicomp` an email and we can provide assistance as well.  



## [Access and Credentials]({{ site.baseurl }}/computing/access_overview/)
This section includes a variety of information about accessing computing resources at the Fred Hutch, including managing credentials for services when required.  If your computing needs extend past that of your desktop computer's capacity or you need to use some of the resources for large scale data storage, these introductory pages will be useful for getting started.  Most resources rely on your HutchNet ID for permissions, however some have additional credentials beyond those and the credential page describes these resources and how to obtain your credentials for them.

Once you have credentials for computing resources of interest the next challenge can be identifying and understanding how to access those resources.  This page describes a variety of access methods including using clients, the basics of `ssh` and other information about best practices and relative strengths and weaknesses of using each method.

If you are having trouble getting started with credentials or deciding what the ideal access method you will be using remember that SciComp provides in person office hours on a weekly basis.  Check The Coop Communities [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gd30dlifri4fu7h104cuqdj0dg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) for current times and locations of office hours.  

## Data Storage

The Hutch, through Center IT and Scientific Computing, support a number of options for storing your data. The service you use to store your data will depend on the nature of the data and the anticipated use.
