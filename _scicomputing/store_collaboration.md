There are Fred Hutch supported data storage systems that allow you to share data with people outside the Hutch, with or without a Hutch ID in order to facilitate data transfer and receipt in collaborations within or outside of the Fred Hutch.

## Aspera

The Aspera storage service is good for medium-sized data sets (up to <fixme> GB). Data stored here can be shared internally and externally.

## OneDrive

OneDrive is a file storage cloud service from Microsoft.  This can be used for data of any volume _is this true?_.  Data can be shared internally and externally.

## Economy Cloud (S3)

Economy cloud buckets can also be configured to allow access to those outside your immediate group.
