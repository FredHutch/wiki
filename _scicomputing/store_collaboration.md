[CenterNet](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/collaboration-tools.html) has information on data storage collaboration tools available at Fred Hutch. These include the Microsoft 365 platform, which integrates Email, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint, is HIPAA-compliant, and provides strong authentication and end-to-end data encryption. The Fred Hutch supported data storage systems allow you to share data with people outside the Hutch, with or without a Hutch ID in order to facilitate data transfer and receipt in collaborations within or outside of the Fred Hutch.
