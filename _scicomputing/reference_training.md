There are a variety of resources for training on various aspects of bioinformatics, analytics and data skills available at the Fred Hutch, in the Seattle area and on the web.

## Resources At Fred Hutch

### In Person Courses

[fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io/) offers frequent, on campus courses on a topics such as R, Python and GitHub; course descriptions can be found [here](http://www.fredhutch.io/resources/). Fred Hutch and SCCA employees can register for these courses by going to [MyHutch](https://fredhutch.okta.com/) and clicking on Hutch Learning. Search for "fredhutch.io" to view and register for all currently available courses. fredhutch.io also helps coordinate additional events and specialized classes in collaboration with The Coop (see below).


### Community Groups

[The Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org/) is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, and works to share information and resources about computational work across the Hutch. The Coop maintains a listserv, calendars of data science events, and [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/), supported by FHBig. [FHBig](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/) is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics Interest Group, a community-based group that hosts a [blog](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/year-archive/) and facilitates information sharing among the bioinformatics research community at the Hutch. Hutch employees can learn more through the links above or by emailing `coophelp` with questions or to be added to our email/newsletter list.

The Coop and FHBig also support community groups that meet regularly to discuss topics ranging from basic data literacy skill building to reproducible computational methods. To learn more about what to expect from these meetings, please visit [our Community Groups GitHub repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups). Current meeting schedules and locations are available on the [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ), and please contact the Coop (coophelp at fredhutch.org) or the relevant channel in [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) for updates or to ask questions.

- **Coop Meetings:** The Coop periodically hosts meetings that rotate among a few different formats, which in the past have included panel discussions, seminars, and community reports on topics related to data-intensive research. See [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) or [The Coop in MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ad1df8e05407e45fa98fba7565738a526%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=1b968d63-dc19-460f-9e6d-cdbd539d1bc6&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) (requires HutchNetID) for more information.

- **Data Visualization Group:** Develops visualizations from data released by [TidyTuesday](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/) and other sources. All programming languages (and even non-coders!) are welcome. Notes about this group can be found [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/blob/master/data_viz.md). See the #data-viz channel on [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) for more information.

- **Nextflow User Group:** Discusses issues related to the use of Nextflow (and other workflow managers like Cromwell) at Fred Hutch. The group welcomes Nextflow users of all levels of expertise as well as those just learning about the tool. See the #nextflow channel on [The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) for more information.

- **Python User Group:** Discusses programming, data analysis, and troubleshooting in Python and related topics in general software development. Python coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. Notes about this group are recorded [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/blob/master/python_coding.md), and check out the #python-user-comm channel on the [Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) for more information.

- **R User Group:** Discusses programming, data analysis, and troubleshooting in R. R coders of all levels of expertise are welcome. Notes about this group are located [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/blob/master/R_coding.md), and check out the #r-user-comm channel on the [Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/) for more information. 

- **Technology Exchange:** Informal learning forum for employees in technology-focused jobs to share technical skills. This group is most appropriate for individuals who want to discuss the technical details of tools commonly used in positions focused on administration and infrastructure. However, anyone is welcome to attend this forum, and many topics will be relevant to researchers in positions that require technical skills. Subscribe to the [TechExchange mailing list](https://lists.fhcrc.org/mailman/listinfo/techexchange) or [visit Tech Exchange in MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a300a2ba11e064d0a9254846bd3dfdbd2%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=d57cfac0-6267-4240-a02d-edd017ba866e&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) (requires HutchNetID) for more information.

- **Retired Community Groups:** All of our groups were created because of the needs voiced by our community. Sometimes those needs change, and we're happy to respond by refocusing our efforts. The following groups have been retired, but are noted here for reference purposes:
  - ~~Software design group:~~ Discusses issues related to software engineering and interface design and invites speakers on specific topics and participants to share their coding projects. This group is not focused on a specific programming language, but rather on issues common across software projects. Notes from this group can be found [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/blob/master/software_dev.md). *Discussions about this topic are now included periodically in the Python User Group*
  - ~~Shiny User Group:~~ The Shiny User Group meets once monthly to discuss this method of using R to create interactive web applications for visualizing data analysis. Notes about this group are located [here](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups/blob/master/shiny.md). *Discussions about this topic are now included periodically in the R User Group*

### Office Hours
