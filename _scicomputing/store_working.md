The _working_ storage platform provides a location for storing research data.  It is intended to be used much like _scratch_ is today.  _Working_ is more robust than _scratch_, using technology similar to what is providing _fast_ file storage today.  There are some important things to know when keeping data in _working_:

 - _working_ is not backed up and **must not** be used as a primary data store.
 - _working_ has limits (quotas) on the amount of data stored- the base quota is 20TB

As with other SciComp supported file systems, the _scratch_ file system is available to most workstations connected to the campus network:

 - `/fh/scratch` on SciComp supported Linux systems
 - `\\center.fhcrc.org\fh\scratch` on Windows
 - `smb://center.fhcrc.org/fh/scratch` on Mac.
