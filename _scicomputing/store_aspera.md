## Sending Files to External Collaborators

Go to the login page and login using your HutchNetID and password.  The first time you log in you'll be prompted to install the Aspera Connect plug-in- download and install the appropriate plug-in for your operating system.

>Note: You may need admin rights on your computer to install the plug-in. Please contact your division IT if you need assistance installing the plug-in.

Once installed, click "New Package" in the menu. This will take you to the "New Package" page.

On the "New Package" page:

 - "To:" enter the recipient email addresses.
 - "Cc" check the "Upload" or "Download" boxes if you'd like to receive email notifications for successful upload and/or download.
 - "Title:" this is the title of the package and the subject of the email message.
 - "Note:" this is the body of the email message.
 - "Contents:" click the "Browse for files..." button to open an upload dialog box or drag-and-drop your files to the "Drop Files and Folders Here" section.
 - Click the "Send Package" button to upload the files. An email message will be automatically sent to the recipients after the files were successfully uploaded.

The recipients will receive an email with a link to download the files. If they have an account on the system, then they will be required to log in before retrieving the files. External collaborators and Center personal without a Faspex account can download the files directly without logging in.

### Notes:

 - This system is for file transfers only and storage space is temporary. Packages are deleted after all recipients have downloaded the package. Unreserved packages are deleted after 7 days.
 - Packages are transferred through a secure SSH tunnel.
 - If you send a package to an external collaborator the link can only be used once to download the package; however, the collaborator could share the link with another person and that person could download the file.
 - If you're transferring sensitive data, please make sure the recipient has a Faspex user account. This will require them to login to Faspex before retrieving the package. If the recipient doesn't have a HutchNetID, contact the HelpDesk and we'll create a Faspex account.
