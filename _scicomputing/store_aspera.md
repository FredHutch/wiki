## Aspera

The Aspera is a storage appliance that runs a heavily tuned storage server and client that enables fast transfer of large data between this system and a host using the Aspera client (either command line or via a browser).  The primary method of operation is to upload the data to the server, then use the web interface to create an email with a link you would then send to those outside the Hutch network.

> Note: space is limited. Because of this, data stored here is deleted after a short period of time making the Aspera inappropriate for primary storage.  Always keep the primary source on one of the other options above (fast, economy, etc.)

Note that the licence we have does not include use of the command line client (`ascp`).  The command line client can be used to move data with other sites which do have the license, but we can only use the web for our installation.

Visit [the Aspera information page](https://aspera.fhcrc.org/index.html) for more details and information on using this storage service.
