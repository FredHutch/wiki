# Backlinks Feature

This document describes the "What Links Here" backlinks feature that has been added to the wiki.

## Overview

The backlinks feature automatically generates pages that show which pages link to a given page, similar to Wikipedia's "What links here" functionality. This helps users discover related content and understand the connections between pages in the wiki.

## How It Works

### 1. Link Detection
The system scans all markdown files in the wiki and extracts:
- Markdown links in the format `[text](/path/to/page/)`
- Reference-style links `[text]: /path/to/page/`

### 2. Backlink Page Generation
For each page that has incoming links, a corresponding backlink page is automatically generated at `/backlinks/path/to/original/page/`.

### 3. User Interface
Each page now includes a "What Links Here" link in the social sharing section at the bottom, next to the existing "Edit this Page" and "Comment" links.

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified

- `generate_backlinks.rb` - Ruby script that analyzes all markdown files and generates backlink pages
- `build.sh` - Main build script that runs the backlinks generator before Jekyll build
- `_includes/social-share.html` - Modified to include the "What Links Here" link
- `_config.yml` - Added backlinks collection configuration
- `_data/backlinks.yml` - Generated data file containing backlink information
- `_backlinks/` - Directory containing generated backlink pages (Jekyll collection)

### Jekyll Configuration

The backlinks are implemented as a Jekyll collection:

```yaml
collections:
  backlinks:
    output: true
    permalink: /backlinks/:path/
```

### Build Process

The recommended build process is:

**For development (serves locally):**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**For production (builds only):**
```bash
./build.sh build
```

This script:
1. Runs the backlinks generator (`ruby generate_backlinks.rb`)
2. Updates dependencies and installs gems
3. Either builds the Jekyll site or serves it locally on port 7979

### Backlinks Generator

The `generate_backlinks.rb` script:
- Scans all markdown files in collections (`_*/*.md`) and root directory (`*.md`)
- Extracts links using regex patterns
- Builds a reverse index of which pages link to which other pages
- Generates markdown files for backlink pages
- Saves summary data to `_data/backlinks.yml`

## Usage

### For Content Authors

When writing content, simply use normal markdown links:
```markdown
[Docker](/compdemos/Docker/)
[Computing Environments](/scicomputing/compute_environments/)
```

The backlinks will be automatically generated when the site is built.

### For Site Visitors

1. Navigate to any page in the wiki
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page
3. Click the "What Links Here" link (ðŸ”—) in the sharing section
4. View the automatically generated list of pages that link to the current page

### Example

If you're reading the Docker page (`/compdemos/Docker/`) and click "What Links Here", you'll be taken to `/backlinks/compdemos/Docker/` which shows:

- **Linking Pages (3)**
  - Using AWS Batch - SciComp provides direct access to AWS Batch in two ways:...
  - PROOF Troubleshooting - proof.fredhutch.org on the Fred Hutch Network...
  - Computing Environments and Containers - The Fred Hutch provides researchers...

## Limitations

- Only processes markdown files (`.md`)
- Only detects standard markdown links and reference-style links
- External links (HTTP/HTTPS) are excluded
- Self-references are excluded
- Generated pages are automatically updated on each build
- Backlinks pages are excluded from search results to avoid cluttering search
- Automatically deduplicates multiple links from the same page to the same target

## Navigation Integration

The backlinks generator automatically creates backlinks pages for all pages referenced in the site's navigation (`_data/navigation.yml`), even if those pages have no incoming content links. This prevents 404 errors when Jekyll tries to access backlinks for navigation-referenced pages.

## Search Exclusion

All backlinks pages are automatically excluded from the site's search results by setting `search: false` in their frontmatter. This prevents the automatically-generated "What Links Here" pages from cluttering search results, ensuring users only find actual content pages when searching.

## Troubleshooting

### Backlinks Not Appearing

1. Ensure you're running `./build.sh` instead of just `jekyll build`
2. Check that the page actually has incoming links from other pages
3. Verify that links are in standard markdown format

### Build Errors

1. Check Ruby script output for warnings about problematic files
2. Ensure all markdown files have valid YAML frontmatter
3. Check file permissions for the `_backlinks/` directory

### Missing Links

1. Verify that links use absolute paths starting with `/`
2. Ensure target pages actually exist
3. Check that source pages are being processed (not in excluded directories)

### 404 Errors for Backlinks Pages

If you see 404 errors like `/backlinks/path/to/page/' not found`, this usually means:
1. The page exists but has no incoming links (navigation-only pages are now handled automatically)
2. There are malformed URLs in your content (e.g., `/_collection/page.md` instead of `/collection/page/`)
3. Old cached URLs or bookmarks pointing to pages that no longer exist

### Redirect Pages

The system automatically handles redirect pages (pages with `permalink` overrides in their frontmatter):
- Creates backlinks pages for both the permalink URL (e.g., `/hdc/hdc_index/`) and Jekyll's internal URL (e.g., `/redirect_hdc_index/`)
- This ensures the "What Links Here" functionality works regardless of which URL is used by Jekyll's templating system
- Prevents 404 errors when Jekyll uses the filename-based URL instead of the permalink URL

### Social Sharing Pages

The system automatically creates backlinks pages for all pages that have social sharing enabled (which includes the "What Links Here" link):
- Pages in collections with `share: true` in their defaults (like `_scicompannounce`, `_compdemos`, etc.)
- Individual pages with `share: true` in their frontmatter
- This prevents 404 errors when users click "What Links Here" on pages that have no incoming links
- Such pages show "Linking Pages (0)" indicating no other pages link to them

### Deduplication

If a page contains multiple links to the same target page, only one backlink entry is created for that source page. For example:
- If `page-a.md` contains 3 different links to `page-b.md`, only one entry for "Page A" appears in the backlinks for "Page B"
- This prevents cluttered backlinks pages with duplicate entries from the same source
- Each source page appears only once per target page, regardless of how many links it contains

### YAML Safety

The system automatically escapes special characters (like quotes) in page titles to prevent YAML parsing errors in the generated backlinks pages.

## Maintenance

The backlinks are regenerated on each build, so they stay automatically up-to-date as content changes. No manual maintenance is required.

The generated `_backlinks/` directory and `_data/backlinks.yml` file can be safely deleted - they will be regenerated on the next build.

## Performance

- Processing time scales with the number of markdown files
- Typical processing time: ~2-5 seconds for 400+ files
- Generated backlink pages are cached by Jekyll like any other pages
- No runtime performance impact on the live site
